A package to give reference types Copy On Write (COW) symantics.


## Swift Package Manager
Update your `Package.swift` to include this to your package dependencies:
```
.package(url: "https://github.com/bscothern/Moo.git", from: "1.0.0")
```

## Usage
Moo works with types that conform to the `Copyable` protocol. You should make a class conform like this

```
import Moo

class SomeType: Copyable {
    required init(copying other: SomeType) {
        // Copy other to create self
    }
    ...
}
```

Once a type is `Copyable` you simply applie the `@COW` property wrapper to the type and it will be coppied when you access the wrapped value.

```
struct SomeOtherType {
    @COW someType: SomeType = SomeType(...)
}
```

**IMPORTANT:** Until Swift exposes the `_modify` accessor as a public access modifier the copy will happen on any read where the wrapped type doesn't have a unique referenece.
